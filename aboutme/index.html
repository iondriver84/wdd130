    Hey everybody, my name is Patrick Hodge. I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah with my wife Maddie and our reptiles, one bearded dragon, one leopard gecko, and two ball pythons. I am majoring in Applied Technologies and am looking forward to making a career change out of hospitality and into the tech world. 
</p>

    Some of my hobbies include hiking, going to the beach, and playing games with my friends, including board games, videogames, and Magic the Gathering. I am very much looking forward to getting to know some of you better and to learn more about web development and html! Thanks for checking out my post.
